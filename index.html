        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        I'm Cate (Catherine) Sullivan, a 4th-year student studying computer engineering at the University of Michigan. <br>
        I'm currently looking for internships for summer 2023 and aiming to graduate in May 2024. <br>
        I have experience in software and electronic hardware, especially within the automotive industry, <br>
        but I'm looking for opportunities across industries and disciplines at the moment. <br>
        </p>
