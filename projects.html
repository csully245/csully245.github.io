        <p>
        Currently, I'm an electical and software divisions member on SPARK, the University of Michigan's electric motorcycle racing team. <br>
        I'm planning on working on battery management system design and supporting existing software and firmware projects. <br> <br>
        I previously worked on MRacing, the University of Michigan's Formula SAE racing team, serving as the motor controllers leader. <br>
        Prior to its merger with MRacing, I was on Michigan Electric Racing, working on wiring and telemetry. <br>
