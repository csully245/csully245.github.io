        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>
        My previous work experience includes:<br>
        Tesla: Systems Validation Intern, Vehicle Software<br>
        Visteon: Test Equipment Development Intern<br>
        CUOS: Undergraduate Research Assistant<br>
        </p>

        <h2>Tesla</h2>
        <h3>Systems Validation Intern, Vehicle Software</h3>
        <h4>May to July 2022</h4>
        <p>
        During my summer at Tesla, I was part of the LV Body Controls Validation group.<br>
        My project was to create a tool to automate speaker tests while maintaining audio fidelity. <br>
        Past solutions for audio tests used a standard microphone, which was subject to background noise, making it nearly unusable. <br>
        In my solution, I developed a device using discrete electronics to record the signal straight from the amp and compare it to the expected signal. <br>
        The project included digital signal processing in Python and large-scale software development work <br>
        to integrate the tool into the wider Tesla LV Body Controls testing suite. <br>
        The tool has been adopted for emergency call and pedestrian warning system testing across all vehicle platforms.

        <h2>Visteon</h2>
        <h3>Test Equipment Development Intern</h3>
        <h4>May to August 2021</h4>
        <p>
        Visteon is an automotive electronics supplier specializing in dashboard electronics.<br>
        Originally strictly under the Ford umbrella, it now serves OEMs globally, though my work was all within Ford. <br>
        I worked on two projects at Visteon: validating the Ford Escape instrument cluster and developing a voltage standards testing tool.<br>
        The instrument cluster validation project involved operating environmental test equiment and <br>
        working with software and hardware engineering teams to address specification failures. <br>
        I also developed a test environment for a set of specifications using Vector CANalyzer and CAPL.<br>
        The voltage standards device was designed to apply the maximum specified voltage to each pair of pins on a given device.<br>
        Previously, this was done manually with a power supply and probes. My project automated this, saving hours of technician time per test.<br>
        The project involved Arduino embedded code and CVI test/GUI control code.

        <h2>CUOS</h2>
        <h3>Undergraduate Research Assistant</h3>
        <h4>February 2020 to April 2021</h4>
        <p>
        CUOS, or the Center for Ultrafast Optical Science, is a leading research lab in laser research,<br>
        both in their fundamental physics and their applications.<br>
        I worked under Dr. Alec Thomas and alongside two Ph.D students as part of the ZEUS team,<br>
        developing the software to manage the most powerful laser in the US.<br>
        My project was to create a GUI to store, aggregate, and display data from each shot of the laser.<br>
        The project was developed in Python and can be found <a href="https://github.com/csully245/CUOS-GUI">here.</a>
